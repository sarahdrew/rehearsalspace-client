## Summary
Find a place to rehearse is hard to find for performers who aren't affiliated with a theater. RehearsalSpace was created with independent performers in mind. This app allows users to view listings of available spaces to use for performance rehearsals. If you've got a place for performers to use, this is the site to list it.
